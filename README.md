CoffeeScript Autocomplete Plus
==============================

Can it be true? Autocompletions for CoffeeScript? I'm here to tell you: They're real, and they're spectacular.

CoffeeScript Autocomplete Plus scans your CoffeeScript files on demand and makes autocomplete suggestions for you.

In addition, this plugin adds the "Coffee: Goto Definition" command, which will look up the class, function or variable definition of the selected token. 

Do you miss having a control-click key combination to go to a definition? Well, that's here too, baby. Rearing and ready to go.

Installation
------------

### Package Control

It is recommended that you use [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) to install CoffeeScript Autocomplete Plus. If you have Package Control installed, use the Package Control: Install Package command and search for CoffeeScript Autocomplete Plus. Ouila. Start coding easier.

### Manual Installation

In order to manually install CoffeeScript Autocomplete Plus, clone the repository into your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory, which can be located by navigating to Preferences -> Browse Packages.

```
git clone https://github.com/justinmahar/SublimeCSAutocompletePlus.git
```

Usage
-----

### Autocomplete

Autocomplete can be triggered in coffee files after the dot operator. With the cursor after a dot operator `.`, press `ctrl+space`. This will trigger autocomplete, which will then try to figure out what you're doing and propose a list of suggestions.

Example usage: Inside a class, you type `this.` and would like a list of the available methods and properties. Press `ctrl+space` to trigger autocomplete, and view the available suggestions.

### Goto Definition

Looking for where a class, function or variable was defined? Look no further.

Place your cursor on any word and press `ctrl+alt+d` in Windows/Linux, and `ctrl+alt+d` in OS X, to goto the definition of the selected class, function or variable.

Alternatively, use `ctrl+alt` + `left click` in Windows/Linux, and `ctrl+alt` + `left click` in OS X.

Default Key Bindings
--------------------

### Windows/Linux:

Autocomplete: `ctrl+space` (after a dot operator)

Goto Definition: `ctrl+alt+d` or `ctrl+alt`+`left click`

### Mac OS X:

Autocomplete: `ctrl+space` (after a dot operator)

Goto Definition: `ctrl+alt+d` or `ctrl+alt`+`left click`

Configuration
-------------

CoffeeScript Autocomplete Plus has the following configurable settings:

* Excluded directories -- `coffee_autocomplete_plus_excluded_dirs`
  - Directories to exclude from searching for CoffeeScript classes, functions and variables.
* Aliases for `this` keyword -- `coffee_autocomplete_plus_this_aliases`
  - Due to lexical scoping you sometimes need to assign an alias for `this`, such as `that` or `self`.

To configure these settings, open Preferences -> Package Settings -> CoffeeScript Autocomplete Plus -> Settings.  It is not recommended that you change the Default settings as they will be overwritten by plugin updates. Instead, make your changes in User settings, which will override the Default settings.

Key bindings can be changed by navigating to Preferences -> Package Settings -> CoffeeScript Autocomplete Plus -> Key Bindings. Same spiel as before about where to put your settings.

Limitations
-----------

Autocomplete is smart, but not Mensa smart. Under the hood, we're not building an index or anything. We're using regular expressions and lots of scanning. As I build out functionality, I will try to fix its limitations. For now, here is the list of TBDs:

* Support for properties and methods of super classes
* Check contents of currently open views besides the active one
* Smarter assignment detection
* Better token parsing
* Goto Definition knows about function parameters
* Add settings for where to look for .coffee files. Right now, it scans all directories in your project folder except for the ones excluded in the settings.
